Motivation
----------
Sometimes you have an itty bitty and slowly-changing bit of stuff to put on the
web, so you write an itty bitty static website.

Then you realize you occasionally want to add content to it, and you want to
let people subscribe to that content with a newsreader.

For example, you wrote an itty bitty application, and you might release bugfix
versions every few months. 

Setting up a CMS is more effort than is needed in this situation. Hand-editing
an RSS file is a pain. What you need is a simple way to quickly generate RSS
from human-friendly plain text. This is why you need SARS.
