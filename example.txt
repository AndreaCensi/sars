# This is a YAML stream (http://yaml.org) but you don't need to know much YAML
# to get the hang of it.
# There are multiple "documents". The first document is the channel information:
---
title: Foo News Feed
link: http://example.com/foo/
description: News for the Foo Project
webmaster: you@example.com

# The second and subsequent documents are items. The first line is the title,
# the second line is the date, and the rest is the item description (Markdown).
# Because line endings are important, don't forget the pipe character.
